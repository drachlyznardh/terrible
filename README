Is it possible to emulate template in C by complex MACRO espansion and repeated
inclusions? Is it ethical?

Well, it works. It requires some busywork and it's not elegant but it works.
Next up, I want to try and generate code from a .c.in file with some sed
substitution and tweak the Makefile to properly automate the code generation
